# Game Popularity API

Here is a simple API project I've made using fastAPI. It showcases trending games from steam and their "hotness". This API is perfect for dashboards, Discord bots, and portfolio projects of sorts.

## Features

- `/trending` — Returns the top trending games on Steam.
- Each game includes:
  - App ID (`appid`)
  - Rank
  - Name
  - Current players
  - Peak players
  - Hotness score (current/peak %)

- Clean, deployable FastAPI backend
- Ready for frontend integration
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly
